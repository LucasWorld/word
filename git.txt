appendices 附录
In Chapter 1, we’re going to cover Version Control Systems (VCSs) and Git
basics—no technical stuff, just what Git is, why it came about in a land full of
VCSs, what sets it apart, and why so many people are using it. Then, we’ll explain
how to download Git and set it up for the first time if you don’t already
have it on your system.

If the book spontaneously combusts at
this point, you should already be pretty useful wielding Git in the time it takes
you to go pick up another copy.
